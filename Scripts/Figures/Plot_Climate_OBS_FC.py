# CODE DESCRIPTION
# Plot_Climate_OBS_FC.py plots observational or modelled rainfall climatologies at points. The script generates the map plots as static svg figures or in a Metview interactive window.
# When plotting interactively, the user must specifie a percentile to plot. When plotting static maps, the percentiles to plot are defined on the basis of the considered forecasting system to plot.

# DESCRIPTION OF INPUT PARAMETERS
# YearS (number, in YYYY format): start year to consider.
# YearF (number, in YYYY format): final year to consider.
# Acc (number, in hours): rainfall accumulation period.
# RunType (string): type of run. Valid values are:
#                                   - "Interactive": to open the plot on an interacive Metview window.
#                                   - "Static": to save the plot on a static svg map.
# DatasetType_OBS_FC (string): defines the type of dataset to plot. Valid values are:
#                                                         - "OBS": for observational climatologies
#                                                         - "FC": for modelled climatologies
# SystemFC (string): forecasting systems to plot. Considered only when DatasetType_OBS_FC="FC"
# MinDays_Perc_list (list of number, from 0 to 1): list of percentages for the minimum number of days over the considered period with valid observations to compute the climatologies.
# NameOBS_list (list of strings): list of the names of the observations to quality check
# Coeff_Grid2Point_list (list of integer number): list of coefficients used to make CPC's gridded rainfall values comparable with  STVL's point rainfall observations. Used only when running the quality check on the clean STVL observations.
# ClimateType_list (list of strings): types of climatology to plot. Valid values are:

#                                                               - "JJA": for the seasonal climatology, summer months (June, July, August)
#                                                               - "SON": for the seasonal climatology, autumn months (September, October, November)
# Perc_list (list of float number, from 0 to 100): list of percentiles to plot.
